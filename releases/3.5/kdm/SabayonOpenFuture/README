About:
	This is KDM theme I made for my own, but I decided to share it with community.
The theme is based on amazing "New Tux" (http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=8418).
It's also use some of Crystal Clear Icons by Everaldo (http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=25668).

Note: If You want to use different background then default one (green) you have to manually edit XML theme file, but
it's truely simple: you need to change only one line at the beginning of the file.
